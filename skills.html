        <p>I can teach you about meditation and the benefits it has. Meditating can help
            you relax by calming the mind. It helps you manage your body's response to stressors
            by making you feel a sense of tranquility. Additionally regular meditation enhances
            attention span and concentration, which ultimately will help you stay focused on tasks
            and activities in your daily life.
        </p>
        <p> In order to start basic meditation it is pretty
            simple. First be seated with your legs crossed and fingers placed near your thighs. Close your eyes and
            start with focusing your breath. Take slow and deep breaths. If you prefer, 
            you can listen to a guided meditation to help you feel more relaxed. Continue doing this 
            for about 5 minutes. 
         </p>
